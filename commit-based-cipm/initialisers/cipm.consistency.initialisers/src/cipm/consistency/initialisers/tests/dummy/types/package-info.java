/**
 * This package, as well as its sub-packages, contain dummy object and
 * initialiser implementations for tests. They can be used to test various
 * methods of the {@link IInitialiser} interface, especially the static utility
 * methods within. <br>
 * <br>
 * The sub-packages feature different initialiser (and object) hierarchies, so
 * that the interaction of initialiser methods with different type hierarchies
 * can be tested.
