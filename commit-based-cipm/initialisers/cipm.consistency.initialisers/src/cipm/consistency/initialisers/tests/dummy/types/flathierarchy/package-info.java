/**
 * This package contains dummy objects without members and one initialiser for
 * each of those objects (both an initialiser class and an initialiser
 * interface). Neither the dummy objects nor their initialisers depend on one
 * another. <br>
 * <br>
 * The constructs defined within this package can be used to test interactions
 * of some {@link IInitialiser} methods with objects/initialisers that are
 * independent of one another.
