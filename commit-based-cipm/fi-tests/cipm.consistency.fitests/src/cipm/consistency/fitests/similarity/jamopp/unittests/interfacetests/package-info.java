/**
 * Contains unit tests for {@link EObject} types, which are extended by other
 * EObject types within the {@link Commentable} type hierarchy. In the said
 * tests, {@link EObject} instances are constructed programmatically and are
 * checked for similarity. <br>
 * <br>
 * Since such types within the {@link Commentable} type hierarchy can have
 * multiple sub-types, all tests should be parameterised over initialisers.
 * Those initialisers may have to be adapted, if there are sub-types, which
 * require additional setup steps to be "valid". Parameterising such tests help
 * spare test code, as sub-types all need their mutual attributes to be tested.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * The tests within this package are meant to be minimal and only to test
 * similarity checking with respect to individual attributes of {@link EObject}
 * instances, in an isolated fashion. This means, each test performs similarity
 * checking on 2 {@link EObject} instances, whose attributes are equal except
 * for one of them. This way, one can pinpoint basic similarity checking errors
 * regarding certain attributes of certain {@link EObject} implementors.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is highly recommended to make the construction of the "main"
 * {@link EObject} instances as obvious and visible as possible, as their
 * construction can get complicated and not knowing all the construction steps
 * can lead to tests not fulfilling their goal. Furthermore, it is also
 * important to adapt the initialisers, rather than using instanceof/if-blocks
 * to define type-specific behaviour. Should certain sub-types diverge from
 * their super type so much that they are incompatible with parameterised tests,
 * it is suggested to instead define special unit tests for the said
 * sub-types.<br>
 * <br>
 * See {@link cipm.consistency.fitests.similarity.jamopp.unittests} to find out
 * more about what test methods do.
