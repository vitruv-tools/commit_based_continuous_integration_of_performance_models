/**
 * Contains unit tests for {@link EObject} classes/interfaces within JaMoPP. In
 * the said tests, {@link EObject} instances are constructed programmatically
 * and are checked for similarity. <br>
 * <br>
 * The tests within this package are meant to test more advanced cases, which
 * are not covered in
 * {@link cipm.consistency.fitests.similarity.jamopp.unittests.impltests} or
 * {@link cipm.consistency.fitests.similarity.jamopp.unittests.interfacetests}.
 * Such cases involve multiple attributes of 2 {@link EObject} instances being
 * different and/or more advanced test setup.
 * 
 * TODO Add complex tests for AdditionalField (once the missing case methods are
 * added)
 * 
 * TODO Add complex tests for LocalVariableStatement with container Variable
 * 
 * TODO Look for further complex test cases (once the missing case methods are
 * added)
