/**
 * This package contains classes and interfaces that can be used to test
 * similarity checking, regardless of which objects are compared during
 * similarity checking. <br>
 * <br>
 * Sub-packages contain tests and utility classes that test similarity checking.
 * They are named and structured to minimise dependencies concerning the context
 * of similarity checking (such as {@link EObject} or JaMoPP). This way,
 * re-using the contents of sub-packages is easier.
